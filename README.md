# Hi, my name is Igor dos Santos Tessaro :octocat:
I'm a software developer but I love to know a little about each area of IT.

My favorite programming language is c#, because i think it is an extremely powerful language to solve any problem and its syntax is very nice. C# was the first language I used professionally, having to study a lot, maybe that made it my favorite language.

When i'm developing some software using C#, without a doubt Visual Studio is the code editor that I feel most productive using, but when the language changes the editor I use the most is Visual Studio Code.

I'm currently working with node using JavaScript, having all the CI/CD configured within Azure DevOps.
